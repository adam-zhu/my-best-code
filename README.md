# my-best-code
Below are the proudest pieces of code I have produced.

# *CONSTANT* time sorting algorithm (not linear)
I will not give away the secret algorithm under the hood, but this is what running it looks like:
```
const rappersOfAllTime = [ "Biggie", "Tupac", "Kendrick", "Kanye", "Rakim", "JayZ", "Lauryn Hill", "Eminem", "Andre 3000", "Lil Wayne", "Ghostface Killah", "Drake", "Nas" ];
const sorted = chappelleSort(array);

console.log(sorted); // [ "Dylan", "Dylan", "Dylan", "Dylan", "Dylan" ];
```
Phenomenal, I know.

# Homage to a genius who understood that the minds of the company's people is where the majority of a company's business lies
```
const patrickBateman = ({ strayCat }) => {
  const comeIntoOwn = hueyLewisAndTheNews => hueyLewisAndTheNews.concat(['hip to be square']);

  return 'videotapes';
};
```
